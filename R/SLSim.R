#' Make a Short-Lived Species Stock Object
#'
#' A function that builds the stock operating model component for a short-lived species from
#' specifications for growth, stock-recruitment, natural mortality rate and spatial distribution. This
#' is a wrapper function and produces a fully customizable MSEtool object of class 'stock'. You can edit
#' that object to include very complex stock dynamics if desired. Note that you can also create lists of these
#' stock objects if you want multiple species or growth-type-groups of the same species.
#'
#' @param Name Character string. The name of the stock object. E.g., "North Pacific Neon Flying Squid"
#' @param Species Character string. The genus and species. E.g., "Ommastrephes bartramii"
#' @param CommonName Character string. The common name. E.g., "Neon Flying Squid"
#' @param nYear Positive Integer. The number of historical years. E.g., 10, (2015 - 2024)
#' @param pYear  Positive Integer. The number of projection years. E.g., 10 (2025 - 2034)
#' @param Seasons Positive Integer. The number of sub-year time steps. E.g., 12 for a monthly model
#' @param CurrentYear Integer. The Calendar year of the last historical year. E.g. 2024.
#' @param nSim Positive Integer. The number of independent simulations. E.g., 4 for testing, 24 for preliminary results, 48 for representative results, 192+ for informing management.
#' @param rec_age Positive Integer. The age the fish is recruited (in seasonal time steps). E.g., given a monthly model (Seasons = 12) a value of 4 means that the stock recruitment function calculates recruiment into the time step 4 months later.
#' @param nages Positive Integer. The number of seasonal time steps that population dynamics will be calculated for. E.g., 24 would be two years in a monthly model. Note that this only necessary if creatures live that long or dynamics are not suitably approximated with a plus group.
#' @param PlusGroup Boolean. Should population numbers be aggregated in the nages age class or just be assumed to die off at nages+1?
#' @param spawndist Numeric vector Seasons long. The seasonal distribution of spawning. E.g., c(0, 0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), is a monthly spawning pattern where 50 per cent of spawning occurs in April.
#' @param Linf Positive real number or vector of positive real numbers nSim long. The asymptotic length.
#' @param K Positive real number or vector of positive real numbers nSim long. The somatic growth rate (von B.) per season.
#' @param t0 Negative real number or vector of negative real numbers nSim long. The theoretical length at age (seasonal) zero.
#' @param Len_CV Positive real number. The coefficient of variation of length at age. Typically between 0.05 and 0.25.
#' @param a Positive real number. Weight (W) at length (L) parameter a. W = aL^b. Converts units of length to weight.
#' @param b Positive real number. Weight (W) at length (L) parameter b. W = aL^b. Typically approximately cubic (3-ish)
#' @param M Positive real number or vector of positive real numbers nSim long. The instantaneous rate of natural mortality per season.
#' @param amat50 Positive real number or vector of positive real numbers nSim long. The age (in seasons) that 50% of individuals are mature, in a logistic maturity model. E.g., 6 in a monthly model would be 50% mature after 6 months.
#' @param amatSLP Positive real number or vector of positive real numbers nSim long. The slope of the logistic maturity model. E.g., 2 in a monthly model.
#' @param h Positive real number or vector of positive real numbers nSim long. Steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship (Bev-Holt)
#' @param sigmaR Positive real number or vector of positive real numbers nSim long. The lognormal standard deviation in recruitment deviations.
#' @param trunc_sigmaR Positive real number. The number of standard deviations to truncate recruitment deviations. E.g., 2 resamples recruitment deviations if over two standard deviations from the mean (upper tail q of 1.96).
#' @param R_AC Positive real number or vector of positive real numbers nSim long. The lag-1 autocorrelation in recruitment deviations.
#' @param R0 Positive real number or vector of positive real numbers nSim long. Unfished recruitment (number of individuals).
#' @param nareas Positive real number. The number of spatial areas. Should match the spec of Frac_area which has nareas-1 rows.
#' @param Frac_area Matrix of fractions nareas-1 x nages. The fraction of stock numbers found in each area by age. Frac_area[1,3] = 0.9 means that 90 percent of individuals of age 3 are found in area 1.
#' @param prob_stay Fraction. The tendency for individuals to remain in the same area among seasonal time steps. Using gravity equations, the function optimizes for movement that obtains Frac_area while staying as close to prob_stay as possible.
